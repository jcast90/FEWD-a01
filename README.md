## About Me
My name is Jonathan Lancaster and I am a Front-End Web Developer with a year of experience. I am transitioning from a life of a cook to the life of a web developer. Even though these are somewhat unrelated fields, I have found a lot of carryover skills and mindests. Being avid learner, I am always searching for the next big thing to learn, whether it be new developments for software or devices to programming languages and frameworks.

I have learned that patience plays a huge factor, as well as, learning to accept failure and to be aware that failure is going to happen. The important thing is to learn from your mistakes and improve on them. When I was first starting out as a developer that was one thing that I struggled with. However, on a daily basis I would have to remind myself of these two principles mentioned above. Because of that, I remained persistent and worked through the problems. Even if those problems took me ten times longer to complete than everyone else. This is not an easy subject, and has a large learning curve, but with a little bit of dedication it's attainable.
